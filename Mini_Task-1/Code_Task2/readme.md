## Objective: Simulate Proof-of-Work by mining a block that satisfies a difficulty condition.

### Task:
- Modify your Block class to include a mineBlock(difficulty) function


- Set difficulty (e.g., hash must start with "0000")


- In mineBlock(), repeatedly increment the nonce until the hash meets the difficulty condition


### Output:
- Print how many nonce attempts were needed
- Measure time taken using a timer
