#### Define Blockchain
Blockchain is similar to an electronic notebook that several individuals can access simultaneously. It makes records of items such as money, messages, or data. Each time someone adds something new, it is recorded as a "block" of data. The blocks are connected one after another, similar to a chain. Once something is entered in the chain, it becomes difficult to change or remove it. Everyone in the network has a replica of the chain, so it is extremely difficult to lie or cheat. This means blockchain is extremely safe and reliable. It operates without a boss or owner, so everyone trusts the system even if they don't trust one another.

#### List 2 real-life use cases
1. Voting Systems
Blockchain can be used for online voting in elections. It makes sure that every vote is counted correctly and cannot be changed. It also helps people vote safely from their phones or computers, and prevents cheating like double voting.

2.  Healthcare Records
Hospitals can use blockchain to store patient records securely. Only the patient and trusted doctors can see the records. This helps in sharing medical history between hospitals while keeping it private and safe from hackers.

#### Draw a block showing: data, previous hash, timestamp, nonce, and Merkle root.

#### Briefly explain with an example how the Merkle root helps verify data integrity.

A Merkle root is a special code (a hash) that represents all the data in a block. It helps quickly check if the data has been changed or not, without looking at the entire data.

Example:
Imagine you have 4 transactions:
T1, T2, T3, and T4.

First, hash each transaction:
H1 = hash(T1)
H2 = hash(T2)
H3 = hash(T3)
H4 = hash(T4)

Then combine and hash them again:
H12 = hash(H1 + H2)
H34 = hash(H3 + H4)

Finally, create the Merkle root:
Root = hash(H12 + H34)

*Now, if someone changes T3, even a tiny bit, the final Merkle root will be different, showing that the data was changed.*


#### What is Proof of Work and why does it require energy?
Proof of Work is a system where computers solve hard puzzles to add new blocks to the blockchain. The first one to solve it gets a reward. It uses a lot of energy because the puzzles need strong computers. This makes the network safe but costly.


#### What is Proof of Stake and how does it differ?

Proof of Stake chooses block makers based on how many coins they lock. More coins mean a higher chance to be chosen. It doesnâ€™t need heavy computers, so it saves energy. It is faster and cheaper than Proof of Work.

#### What is Delegated Proof of Stake and how are validators selected?

In Delegated Proof of Stake, people vote for a few validators. Those with the most votes make new blocks. This system is fast and uses less power. Voters can change their choice anytime to keep it fair.
