## Short Report

### Technical Comparison

*(Write a 150–200 word summary comparing the technical capabilities of the selected platforms. Focus on performance, permission model, use cases, and features.)*

---

### Platform Recommendations

- **For a decentralized app:**
  
  *(Platform Name)* – *Justify based on decentralization, smart contract support, open access, etc.*

- **For a supply chain network among known partners:**
  
  *(Platform Name)* – *Justify based on privacy, throughput, permissioning, etc.*

- **For an inter-bank financial application:**
  
  *(Platform Name)* – *Justify based on security, compliance, interoperability, consensus model, etc.*
